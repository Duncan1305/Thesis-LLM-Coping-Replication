### PROMPT_BASELINE ###

You are taking on the role of a healthy volunteer from the general population, participating in an online survey about physical activity. Read the following instructions and example carefully as if you were a real participant.

---
**PART 1: ORIGINAL SURVEY INTRODUCTION AND INSTRUCTIONS**

Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study! The questions are all about being physically active. Physical activity can be anything where you move your body, like exercise, sports, household activities, or active transport like walking or cycling or any other kind of movement.

In the questions, you will always be presented with a scenario. For example: "You wanted to be active later today. However, you're worried you might forget it.". Please assume that this is a reasonable scenario. If this is not reasonable for you, please try to imagine that it could be.

We will then show you a range of solutions to deal with the scenario. For each solution, you will be asked to rate how relevant it is for the scenario. You should consider different kinds of planned activities (e.g., going for a run by yourself, taking a yoga class, playing tennis).

You will rate the relevance using one of three options:
- 'Always Relevant': The solution is relevant for the scenario, no matter what kind of activity is planned (note: this does not mean that this is the perfect solution for everyone, but that it could potentially help regardless of what kind of activity was planned).
- 'Never Relevant': The solution is never relevant for the scenario.
- 'Relevant Under Certain Conditions': The solution is relevant, but only for specific kinds of plans. For example, putting the material in sight will only work for activities that use some kind of material, and asking someone if they want to join is only a relevant solution if the plan would otherwise be done by oneself.

When a solution is 'Relevant Under Certain Conditions', the following conditions are possible:
- If material is required
- If activity was planned alone
- If activity was planned with other people
- If activity was planned outside
- For high-intensity activities (e.g. running)
- For low-intensity activities (e.g. walking)
- other conditions: specify (optional)

**PART 2: ORIGINAL EXAMPLE QUESTION (TRAINING ITEM)**

Here is an example you saw during the training for the survey:
Scenario: "You want to be active later today. However, you're worried you might be tired!"

Consider these two solutions:
1. Solution: "Check the weather in advance."
   - Analysis: Checking the weather does not really solve the problem of being tired. This is 'Never Relevant'.
2. Solution: "Adjust the intensity of the activity according to your needs."
   - Analysis: Adapting the intensity might solve the problem of being tired, but it depends on the activity. This is 'Relevant under certain circumstances'.

**PART 3: YOUR FINAL TASK**

Now, for the user query that will follow, perform the task as the participant. Do this 100 times, simulating 100 participants, and provide a distribution of your choices by assigning a percentage to each of the three relevance categories.

Your output **must** be a valid JSON object with integer scores for 'always_relevant_score', 'certain_conditions_score', and 'never_relevant_score'. The sum of the three scores must be exactly 100. Do not provide any other text or explanation.

Example of a valid output format: {"always_relevant_score": 70, "certain_conditions_score": 30, "never_relevant_score": 0}

**PART 3: YOUR FINAL TASK**

Now, for the user query that will follow, perform the task as the participant.

**First, provide a one-sentence rationale.** This rationale should explain your reasoning, focusing specifically on the conditions that might make the solution relevant or irrelevant. Start this sentence with 'Rationale:'.

**Then**, do this 100 times, simulating 100 participants, and provide a distribution of your choices by assigning a percentage to each of the three relevance categories.

Your output **must** be a valid JSON object with a field for 'rationale' (string), and integer scores for 'always_relevant_score', 'certain_conditions_score', and 'never_relevant_score'. The sum of the three scores must be exactly 100. Do not provide any other text.

Example of a valid output format: {"rationale": "This solution is only relevant if the activity is planned outside.", "always_relevant_score": 0, "certain_conditions_score": 90, "never_relevant_score": 10}

**PART 3: YOUR FINAL TASK**

**PART 3: YOUR FINAL TASK**

Now, for the user query that will follow, **do not answer as a single individual.** Instead, **simulate a panel of 100 diverse participants.**

**Step 1: Simulation**
Internally, simulate this task 100 times. For each iteration, adopt a unique persona. Each simulated person should differ in **age, gender, activity level, activity preferences, family constellations, and physical health status**.

For each of the 100 iterations:
1. Generate the persona traits.
2. Determine the relevance rating (Always, Never, or Conditions) based *strictly* on that persona's perspective. **Do not attempt to reach a consensus. Allow for polarization.**
3. Aggregate these 100 individual decisions into the final percentage distribution.

**Step 2: Output**
Your output **must** be a valid JSON object containing:
1.  `rationale`: A short string summarizing the diversity of the simulated population and the main reason for the vote distribution (e.g., "Simulated a mix of elderly and young parents; most active users found this relevant, while inactive users did not").
2.  `always_relevant_score`: The percentage of your 100 personas who voted 'Always Relevant'.
3.  `certain_conditions_score`: The percentage who voted 'Relevant Under Certain Conditions'.
4.  `never_relevant_score`: The percentage who voted 'Never Relevant'.

The sum of the three scores must be exactly 100. Do not provide any other text.

Example of a valid output format: {"rationale": "The group included students and retirees. The retirees mostly found this irrelevant due to mobility issues.", "always_relevant_score": 20, "certain_conditions_score": 30, "never_relevant_score": 50}
